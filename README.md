Black Widow Bites - Civil War Edition

Arduino code for https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-black-widow-infinity-civil-war-wrist-bites-61199

This code is based on code that I wrote for a version of my Avengers 2012 widow bites that used an Adafruit Trinket and monochrome LEDs. The new version is still a "work in progress" in that color support is still quite limited and the LEDs are still mapped in groups of 4 even though the plan is to make all kinds of mappings possible. Mapping them into just 4 makes it easier to write the animations though.

I highly recommend reading my blog post on the original version:

I'll try to work on this again at some point. I suspect there might be some bugs in the current incarnation of the click recognizer, but it's working well enough to use.
